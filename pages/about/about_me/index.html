        <h3>Hello There!</h3>
        <h1>I'm JUVENILE CHRISTEN BAJO</h1>
        <p>
          A 2nd Year Information Technology Student
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>"I'm a curious soul, weaving words and knowledge to enlighten your world."</h3>
        <p>My journey in IT started during my teenage years when I discovered my fascination with technology. I was captivated by the world of computers and the endless possibilities they offered. Despite numerous challenges, I pursued my passion relentlessly, studying late into the night and learning from every setback.</p>

<p>During my time at school, I found inspiration and support from my teachers and classmates. They encouraged me to explore my interests further and guided me in honing my skills. It was in this school setting that I began working on exciting IT projects, from designing apps to diving into artificial intelligence. The thrill of creating and impacting lives solidified my passion.
  There were tough times, sleepless nights, and moments of self-doubt, but I always remembered the mantra: "Breakthroughs follow setbacks."  </p>
 <p>As I continue my studies in IT, I know that my journey is just beginning. My story serves as a reminder that with unwavering passion and motivation, dreams can become reality, especially when nurtured in a supportive school environment.</p>
